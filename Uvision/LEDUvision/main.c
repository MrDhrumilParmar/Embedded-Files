Respected Chief Warden, 
I am Dhrumil Parmar (U20EC160). I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics Engineering SVNIT. I extend my respectful greetings to you. I am writing to express my sincere apologies for my failure to follow the proper procedure of submitting my hostel room to the hostel supervisor. I deeply regret any inconvenience or disruption this may have caused to the hostel administration and the institute's functioning.

I acknowledge that I was responsible for ensuring the appropriate room handover to the hostel supervisor upon my departure. However, due to my oversight, I failed to complete this necessary step before leaving. I understand that this failure to comply with the established rules and regulations set forth by the institute constitutes a violation of the hostel guidelines.
 I want to request your kind consideration in reconsidering the fine that has been imposed on me as a result of my actions. While I accept full responsibility for my mistake, I assure you it was unintentional and not driven by malicious intent. I deeply regret any inconvenience or burden caused by my oversight. 
I have always respected the hostel administration's and the institute's efforts to maintain a smooth and orderly living environment for all students. I acknowledge the importance of complying with the hostel premises' rules and regulations. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and will be more diligent in following the required procedures in the future. 
I sincerely apologize for my failure to submit the room correctly and for any inconvenience this may have caused the hostel administration. I request the cancellation of the imposed fine. I understand that fines ensure adherence to the rules and regulations and acknowledge their importance. I request your understanding and leniency in considering my appeal to cancel the imposed fine. I assure you that I will take the necessary steps to rectify my behaviour and strictly adhere to the rules and regulations moving forward. 
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I sincerely hope for a favourable response from your esteemed office. 
Yours sincerely,.
